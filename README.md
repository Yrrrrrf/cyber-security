# Cybersecurity R&D Lab üõ°Ô∏è

This repository is a personal workshop for building, testing, and documenting security tools and concepts. It's a practical learning environment for both offensive and defensive security, combining the flexibility of Python with the performance of Go.

## Core Philosophy

The goal of this lab is to **learn by doing**. It serves as a personal collection of practical implementations, research notes, and reusable code, acting as a living document of my cybersecurity learning journey.

## Project Structure

The lab is organized into several key directories, each with a distinct purpose:

*   **`go-arsenal/`**: A self-contained Go module for building high-performance, statically-compiled security tools. This is ideal for fast, concurrent applications like network scanners or web crawlers.
*   **`arsenal/`**: A collection of standalone, task-oriented security tools written in Python. Perfect for rapid development and leveraging the rich Python ecosystem.
*   **`src/`**: The core Python library for the project. Contains reusable modules (e.g., for networking, crypto) that are used by the scripts in the `arsenal/`.
*   **`playbooks/`**: The knowledge base. This is where documentation, methodology guides, and detailed CTF walkthroughs are stored.
*   **`scripts/`**: Miscellaneous, one-off Python scripts for quick experiments or testing a specific library.
*   **`resources/`**: A repository for all non-code assets, such as wordlists, Yara rules, configuration files, and other data needed by the tools.
